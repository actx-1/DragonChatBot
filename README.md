# Dragon Chat Bot

This is currently primarily intended to be a Discord bot, though compatibility with other networks may be added.

Everyone involved in this project may use a different programming language. Each portion written in a different language will need to use some form of IPC to communicate, such as pipes, sockets, or memory mapped files.

This project might not actually start for a while.
